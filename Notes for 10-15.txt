referring to a form console.log(document.forms.length) is a collection of forms so saying how many form elements are on the page.

can pull the object name out by saying document.myForm as in document.className

document.forms[0].elements.length is trying to figure out the length of the first form on  the document.

document.myForm.firstName.value then pulls the value of firstName from that first form

onreset specifies the javascript code to execute when the form is reset

onsubmit specifies the javascript to execute when the form is submitted
type="submit" works

the form property for all elements stores the name of the form that the element is contained in 

onclick= "checkText(this.form)" when inside a form****
function checkText(frm)
{
  form here is form from form element is contained in
}


method="get" puts that into the url and is not secure but puts value in the url
get----
appends form0data into the url in name/value pairs
the length of a url is limited to about 3000 characters
never use get to send sensitive data! ( will be visible in the url)
useful for form submissions where a user want to book mark the result g
get is better for non-secure data, like query strings in google
 

method="post" puts that data into the server if connected but is more secure so won't show up in the url
post-----
Appends form-data inside the body of the http request (data is not show is in url)
Has no size limitations
Form Submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

checked returns a booleanValue for is it checked yes or no
